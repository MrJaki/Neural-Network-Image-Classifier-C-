# Neural-Network-Image-Classifier-C-
A simple from-scratch neural network in C# that reads images, converts them to grayscale, flattens them, and trains a small feedforward model to output a 3-bit class. Supports loading/saving weights and testing custom images. Pure manual backprop—no ML libraries, just raw math and bitmap processing.
